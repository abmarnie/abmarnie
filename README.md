## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work on enterprise business applications, primarily as a specialist in web API and database design (and cleanup jobs), though I often get pulled into frontend state management as well (I care deeply about UX). Beyond coding, I like to step up into product management and leadership whenever the opportunity arises, so I can have a greater impact on making projects succeed (no matter the constraints or how bad the situation might be). Ultimately, Iâ€™m here not just to solve problems, but to be a pleasant, high-integrity person who uplifts those around me and treats people with the respect that all humans deserve.

My favorite domains to work in as a hobbyist are:
- Game Development
- Developer and Artist Tooling & Automation
- Scientific Computing

I live by KISS, YAGNI, and the 80/20 rule, but I also take testing (manual, unit, integration, snapshot) and tech debt seriously. Left unchecked, tech debt erodes morale, slows delivery, creates buggy UX, and kills scalability; worst case, a competitor wins your client by delivering the 20% of features that matter most, with better UX, faster turnaround, or offering additional services like providing source code access or individual-client-tailored feature development. That said, tech debt is often a necessary evil which enables value delivery, and so having a "budget" for technical debt is a genuinely useful strategy; it all depends on the specific business context.

I make my money with .NET (C#), Angular (TypeScript), and SQL (which I actually greatly enjoy writing), but my current favorite language is Zig for its imperative nature and lack of footguns. I also love the array programming paradigm (MATLAB, NumPy, Julia), functional programming when practical (F#, or just keeping functions close to pure without wrecking performance), and working in game engines (Godot, Unity).

My least favorite environments are low-trust cultures, purely sales-driven cultures, overly bureaucratic cultures, and those with opaque leadership. Often, the only things keeping devs sane in these environments is a shared sense of solidarity for the suffering they go through, which is not a sustainable way to motivate high performers who want to align themselves with your company's success.

If you want to work with a kind person with high standards who can align their high ambitions with yours to deliver impactful products as a business or technical consultant, shoot me an email at abmarnie9@gmail.com.
