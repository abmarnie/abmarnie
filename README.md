## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work on enterprise business applications, primarily acting as a specialist on Web API and database design, but I also get paid to work on frontend state management often. Beyond coding and mathematics (at one point I was attempting a Math PhD...), I also like to step up and take on product management and team lead tasks whenever the opportunity arises, so that I can have more of an impact to make projects I work on a success (no matter the constraints or how bad the situation might be). Ultimately though, I was put on this Earth not just to solve problems, but also to be a pleasant person with high levels of integrity and who uplifts those around me.

My favorite domains to work in as a hobbyist are:
- Game Development
- Developer and Artist Tooling
- Scientific Computing

I live by KISS, YAGNI, and the 80/20 rule, but I also take testing (manual, unit, integration, and snapshot) and tech debt seriously; not paying tech debt down can lead to serious issues in terms of team morale, developer churn, developer velocity, buggy and janky feeling UX, backend scalability issues, etc. (worst case scenario, a talented engineer leaves and scoops your big client because they can move 10x faster and only implement the 20% subset of features which are business critical to that client for 5% of the cost -- I have seen it happen). With that being said, tech debt is a necessary evil and so I am pragmatic about things; it all depends on the context.

I make my money using .NET (C#), Angular (TypeScript), and SQL (which I enjoy writing for some reason), but my favorite language as of late is Zig due to its straightforward imperative nature and lack of footguns. I also greatly enjoy the array programming paradigm (MATLAB, Python NumPy, Julia), am an appreciator of functional programming (F#, or just generally making functions as close to pure as is reasonable without seriously affecting performance), and enjoy working in game engines (Godot, Unity).

My least favorite things are working in low-trust environments (places where fear-of-looking-stupid is rampant because asking stupid questions is penalized), working in highly bureaucratic environments (places where one has to ask for permission before even beginning investigation into potential UX improvements for customers or penalized for automating tedious tasks for your team), and working with lack of transparency from leadership (places where developers must come up with tactics for solving problems without knowing the entire relevant context, such as who the stakeholders are, what the actual hard business-critical cutoff dates are, the relative importance of all the tasks, important upcoming initiatives and projects, etc.).

If you want to work with someone with high standards who can commit to making your projects run on time, shoot me an email at abmarnie9@gmail.com.
