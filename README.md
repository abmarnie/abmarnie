## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I mostly work on enterprise business applications, primarily as a specialist in Web APIs and database design (though I often dabble in frontend state management and tooling/automation as well). Beyond coding, I like to step up into product management and leadership whenever the opportunity arises, so I can have a greater impact on project success -- no matter the constraints or how bad the situation might be. Ultimately though, Iâ€™m here not just to solve problems, but additionally to be a pleasant, high-integrity person who uplifts those around me.

My favorite domains to work in as a hobbyist are:
- Game Development
- Developer and Artist Tooling & Automation
- Scientific Computing

I live by KISS, YAGNI, and the 80/20 rule, but I also take testing (manual, unit, integration, performance, snapshot) and tech debt seriously (though, debt can serve a purpose at times).

I primarily work in .NET (C#), Angular (TypeScript), and SQL (which I actually greatly enjoy writing). My current favorite language is Zig for it's emphasis on being low-level while still retaining ergonomics and practicality. I also love the array programming paradigm (MATLAB, NumPy, Julia), functional programming (when practical), and working in game engines (Godot, Unity).

If you want to work with a kind person with high standards who can align their high ambitions with yours to deliver impactful products as a business or technical consultant, shoot me an email at abmarnie9@gmail.com.
