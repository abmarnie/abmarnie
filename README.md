## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work on enterprise business applications, primarily acting as a specialist on Web API and database design, but I also greatly stepping up to take on product management and team lead tasks to enable those around and make whatever project I am working on a success (no matter how bad the situation might be).

My favorite domains to work in as a hobbyist are:
- Game Development
- Developer and Artist Tooling
- Scientific Computing

I live by KISS, YAGNI, and the 80/20 rule, but I also take tech debt seriously and know that not paying it down leads to serious issues in terms of team morale, developer velocity, scalability when expanding the business, etc. 

I am most productive in .NET (C#) and Angular (TypeScript) so I prefer to use those when trying to make money, but my favorite language as of late is Zig due to it's straightforward imperative nature and lack of footguns. 
I also greatly enjoy functional programming languages (F#), and array programming languages (MATLAB, Python NumPy, Julia). I am also a fan of game engines (Godot, Unity).

My least favorite things are working in low-trust environments (you can tell if fear-of-looking-stupid is rampant, or asking stupid questions is penalized), working in highly bureacratic environmnets where one might get penalized for doing something such as easy-win task automations without asking for permission first, and working with lack of transparency from leadership (strategy must inform tactics).

If you would like to work with me, shoot me an email at abmarnie9@gmail.com.
