## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work on enterprise business applications, primarily acting as a specialist on Web API and database design.

My favorite domains to work in as a hobbyist are:
- Game Development
- Developer and Artist Tooling
- Scientific Computing

I live by KISS, YAGNI, and the 80/20 rule, but I also take tech debt seriously and know that not paying it down leads to serious issues in terms of team morale, developer velocity, scalability when expanding the business, etc. 

I am most productive in .NET (C#) and Angular (TypeScript) so I prefer to use those when trying to make money, but my favorite language as of late is Zig due to it's straightforward imperative nature and lack of footguns. 
I also greatly enjoy functional programming languages (F#), and array programming languages (MATLAB, Python NumPy, Julia). I am also a fan of game engines (Godot, Unity).

If you would like to work with me, shoot me an email at abmarnie9@gmail.com.
