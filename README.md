## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work on enterprise business applications, primarily acting as a specialist on Web API and database design, but I also get paid to work on frontend state management (Angular) often. Beyond working on tickets, I also like to step up and take on product management and team lead tasks whenever the opportunity arises, so that I can have more of an immpact to make the project a success (no matter the constraints or how bad the situation might be).

My favorite domains to work in as a hobbyist are:
- Game Development
- Developer and Artist Tooling
- Scientific Computing

I live by KISS, YAGNI, and the 80/20 rule, but I also take tech debt seriously and know that not paying it down leads to serious issues in terms of team morale, developer churn, developer velocity, scalability when expanding the business, etc. 

I am most productive in .NET (C#) and Angular (TypeScript) so I prefer to use those when trying to make money, but my favorite language as of late is Zig due to it's straightforward imperative nature and lack of footguns. I also enjoy functional programming languages (F#), array programming languages (MATLAB, Python NumPy, Julia), and game engines (Godot, Unity).

My least favorite things are working in low-trust environments (places where fear-of-looking-stupid is rampant because asking stupid questions is penalized), working in highly bureacratic environments (places where one might be penalized for asking permission to begin an independent investigation), and working with lack of transparency from leadership (places where developers must come up with tactics for solving problems without knowing the entire relevant context such as who the stakeholders are, what the hard cutoff dates are, the relative importance of all the tasks, etc).

If you would like to work with me, shoot me an email at abmarnie9@gmail.com.
