## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work on enterprise business applications, primarily as a specialist in web API and database design, though I often get pulled into frontend state management as well. Beyond coding and mathematics (at one point I was attempting a Math PhD...), I like to step up into product management and leadership whenever the opportunity arises, so I can have a greater impact on making projects succeed (no matter the constraints or how bad the situation might be). Ultimately, Iâ€™m here not just to solve problems, but to be a pleasant, high-integrity person who uplifts those around me and treats people with the respect that all humans deserve.

My favorite domains to work in as a hobbyist are:
- Game Development
- Developer and Artist Tooling & Automation
- Scientific Computing

I live by KISS, YAGNI, and the 80/20 rule, but I also take testing (manual, unit, integration, snapshot) and tech debt seriously. Left unchecked, tech debt erodes morale, slows delivery, creates buggy UX, and kills scalability; worst case, a competitor wins your client by delivering the 20% of features that matter most, with better UX, faster turnaround, or offering additional services like providing source code access. That said, tech debt is a necessary evil; it all depends on the context.

I make my money with .NET (C#), Angular (TypeScript), and SQL (which I actually greatly enjoy writing), but my current favorite language is Zig for its imperative nature and lack of footguns. I also love the array programming paradigm (MATLAB, NumPy, Julia), functional programming when practical (F#, or just keeping functions close to pure without wrecking performance), and working in game engines (Godot, Unity).

My least favorite environments are low-trust cultures (where fear-of-looking-stupid is rampant), heavy bureaucracy (where you need permission to investigate UX improvements or automate tedious tasks, or are not allowed to submit pull requests to other team's source code to get things done on time), and opaque leadership (where devs must solve problems without key context like stakeholder priorities, actual hard deadlines, upcoming strategic initiatives, etc). Often, the only things keeping devs sane in these environments is a shared sense of solidarity for the suffering they go through, which is not sustainable way to motivate high performers who wants to align themselves with your company's success.

If you want to work with someone with high standards who can commit to making your projects run on time, shoot me an email at abmarnie9@gmail.com.
